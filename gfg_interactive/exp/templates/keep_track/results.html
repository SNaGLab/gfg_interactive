        <h1>Your results!</h1>

        <p>
        You remembered {{ average_correct }}% of all relevant words correctly.

        That is better than {{ perc_better }}% of the population. 
        </p>

        <h2>What do my results mean?</h2>

        <p>
        We measured your ability to keep distinct items in mind from relevant categories, 
        while ignoring those from irrelevant categories. This is thought to depend to two distinct abilities: <br>

        <strong>General executive function</strong> relates to your ability to stay focused on the task despite all of distractors in your environment, or even from your own thoughts.
        General executive function also helps you maintain specific words in mind, in the face of distacting, irrelevant words from other categories. <br>

        <strong>Updating</strong> is thought to reflect how accurately you can remove and replace items in working memory.
        For example, if you were asked to keep track of animals and saw the word "Cat" followed by "Cow", you need to forget about the now irrelevant "Cat" and remember the word "Cow" to answer correctly.

        Executive functions are critical for navigating the complex environment we navigate daily and decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinsons. <br><br>

        When looking at your results, keep in mind that it is normal for people to vary in executive functions.

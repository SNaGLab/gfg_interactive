        <h2>What do my results mean?</h2>

        <p>
        In this working memory task, we measured your ability to keep distinct items in mind from relevant categories, 
        while ignoring items from irrelevant categories. Research indicates that this ability relies on two related, but 
        distinct abilities: <strong>"general executive function"</strong> and <strong>"updating ability"</strong>. 

        <strong>General executive function</strong> relates to your ability to stay focused on the task, and maintain 
        the goals of the task, despite all of the potentially distractors in your environment, or even from your own thoughts.
        General executive function is also thought to help you maintain the specific words you are trying to hold on to in working
        memory in the face of distracting words from other categories.

        <strong>Updating ability</strong> is thought to reflect how accurately you can remove and replace items in working memory.
        For example, if you were asked to keep track of animals and saw the word "Cat" followed by "Cow", good updating abilities would help you forget about the now irrelevant "Cat" and remember the word "Cow".

        Research indidcates that strong executive functions are critical for navigating the complx environment we live in, and decline during the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. 

        When looking at your results, keep in mind that it is normal for people to vary in executive functions.

        <h2>Your results!</h2>

        <p>
        You remembered {{ average_correct }}% of all relevant words correctly.

        That is better than {{ perc_better }}% of the population. 

        As more people take this test, feel free to re-check your results under "Discover" to see how everyone in the study performed on this test.

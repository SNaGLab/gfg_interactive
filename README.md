Genes for good / cotwins task server 

This is the base code that will be used a Genes For Good colorado task server and a server for EF tasks for the COTwins study. 

The flask project is divided into a general app.py file, a experiments.py file that subroutes to /exp and handles the actual running the experiments and a dashboard.py routed to /dashboard that will display a dashboard to logged in admins. Also plans to add a /results route that will show individual subjects their results.
